Seller-Buyer Andoird Application

‘Top offers’ is an android application that links sellers and buyers, providing efficient and time-saving way for e-commerce.

Sellers have their own space where they can upload different items available for buyers. For each item they can give a specific title, price, quantity, description and upload or take an image. A seller can edit or delete an existing product, which are related to their profile. Besides, they are able to monitor their product’s history orders. They can also decide whether they will approve the order or reject it (two different option buttons).

Buyers can make orders from all available products. They may also choose a specific location as a delivery address. Moreover, they can see a history list of their previous and current orders. When a buyer receives their order, they can mark the order as ‘received’. If the product is not received, the buyer may mark the order as ‘not received’, informing the seller there might be an issue with the delivery, so he/she can take an appropriate action to complete it. In this way, the seller can track the sent products, which provides transparency in relations between sellers and buyers.
